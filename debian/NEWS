pristine-tar (1.39) unstable; urgency=medium

  This version of pristine-tar switches to xdelta3 internal format by
  default (bringing in particular, support for bigger tarballs). The
  switch should be seamless, but newly checked in tarballs will be
  understood only by versions of pristine-tar starting with 1.35 (note
  that stretch features version 1.38). The old format will be
  understood indefinitely, but support for checking in tarballs using
  the old format may be dropped in the future.
