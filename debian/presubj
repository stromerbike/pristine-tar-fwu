Reporting pristine-tar bugs
---------------------------

If you are about to report a bug about pristine-tar being unable to reproduce a
given upstream tarball, *please* make sure to include in your bug report
information that will allow the pristine-tar maintainers to actually *download*
the original tarball with which you had problems.

Without the original tarball itself, it is very difficult to fully understand
(and fix) the problem.
